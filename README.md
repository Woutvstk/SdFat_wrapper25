This is a wrapper library for the SdFat library by Greiman. The focus of the wrapper is API compatibility with the arduino-esp32 SD library. (https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/SD) 
The functionality is limited and it is not intended to be a general purpose library.

For more info and the original library please refer to (https://github.com/greiman/SdFat)
